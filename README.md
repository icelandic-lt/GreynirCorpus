# GreynirCorpus

## A large treebank of parsed Icelandic text

**GreynirCorpus** is a large, parsed treebank of modern Icelandic text.

The treebank includes over **7 million sentences**, approximately 120 million words,
extracted from news and government sites on the web, parsed into full constituency trees
in flat text format. It is published under
the [**Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 license**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
and thus open and free for general use.

The treebank has two parts: (1) a large set of sentences parsed mechanically
using the [Greynir](https://github.com/mideind/ReynirPackage) rule-based parser;
and (2) a smaller gold standard corpus of sentences with parse trees that are manually
corrected and verified.

The annotation scheme is extensively documented
[in a 60-page PDF](https://github.com/mideind/ReynirPackage/blob/master/doc/_static/annotation_instructions.pdf?raw=true).

GreynirCorpus is a product of [Miðeind ehf.](https://mideind.is), Reykjavík, Iceland,
to which it should be attributed.

The project was partially funded by the Icelandic
government's *Strategic research and development programme for language technology*
(*Markáætlun í máltækni*), operated by [Rannís](https://rannis.is).
