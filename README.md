# GreynirCorpus

## A large treebank of parsed Icelandic text

**GreynirCorpus** is a large, parsed treebank of modern Icelandic text.

The treebank includes over **7 million sentences**, approximately 120 million words.
The text is extracted from news and government sites on the web and
parsed into full constituency trees in flat text format. The format is
similar to that of the [Penn Treebank](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.9.8216&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
and [The Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus (IcePaHC)](https://linguist.is/icelandic_treebank/Icelandic_Parsed_Historical_Corpus_(IcePaHC)).

The treebank is published under
the [**Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 license**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
and is thus open and free for general use, with attribution.

The treebank has two parts: (1) a large corpus of sentences parsed mechanically
using the [Greynir](https://github.com/mideind/ReynirPackage) rule-based parser;
and (2) a smaller gold standard corpus of sentences with parse trees that are manually
corrected and verified.

The annotation scheme is extensively described in a 60-page
[guideline document (PDF)](https://github.com/mideind/ReynirPackage/blob/master/doc/_static/annotation_instructions.pdf?raw=true).

GreynirCorpus is a product of [Miðeind ehf.](https://mideind.is), Reykjavík, Iceland,
to which it should be attributed.

The project was partially funded by the Icelandic
government's *Strategic research and development programme for language technology*
(*Markáætlun í máltækni*), operated by [Rannís](https://rannis.is).
